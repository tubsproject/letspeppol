# LetsPeppol Proxy
This is what runs on api.letspeppol.org.

## Usage (V2)
First, set which proxy host you want to use. By default, use:
```sh
export PROXY_HOST=https://api.letspeppol.org
```

### Get an access token
Next, get an access token (this requires the local `ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY` env var to be the same as the proxy instance you will be talking to):
```sh
export ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY=...
export ONE=`node token.js 9944:nl862637223B02`
export TWO=`node token.js 0208:0734825676`
export THREE=`node token.js 0208:0636984350`

echo $ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY
echo $ONE
echo $TWO
echo $THREE
```

All users will be serviced through Peppyrus unless you set the `BACKEND` env var to one of the other available backends, which are currently 'acube', 'scrada' and 'ion'.

### Check connectivity
```sh
curl $PROXY_HOST/v2
```

### Send a UBL document
Not all sender/receiver combinations work yet, but the following ones do.
Run this command from the proxy folder (note the relative file path pointing to [../docs/](../docs/)):
```sh
pnpm build
node ./build/src/genDoc.js invoice 9944:nl862637223B02 0208:0734825676 asdf > ./doc.xml
curl -X POST --data-binary "@./doc.xml" -H "Authorization: Bearer $ONE" $PROXY_HOST/v2/send
```

### Activate and de-activate SMP records
FIXME: currently not implemented for Peppyrus backend.
```sh
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $ONE" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' $PROXY_HOST/v2/reg
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $ONE" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' $PROXY_HOST/v2/unreg
```

### Read invoices
To list invoices and credit notes you have sent and received. There are 4 collections, each filtered for the authenticated legal entity:
* /v2/invoices/outgoing
* /v2/invoices/incoming
* /v2/credit-notes/outgoing
* /v2/credit-notes/incoming

Default page size is 20.
```sh
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TWO" "$PROXY_HOST/v2/invoices/outgoing" | json
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $THREE" "$PROXY_HOST/v2/credit-notes/incoming?page=2&pageSize=2" | json
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ONE" "$PROXY_HOST/v2/invoices/incoming?page=1" | json
```

This will give an array of objects that look like this:
```json
  {
    "platformId": "peppyrus:dca93007-6f8c-4ef7-943e-29ceff2c2a57",
    "docType": "invoice",
    "direction": "outgoing",
    "senderId": "9944:nl862637223B02",
    "senderName": "SupplierTradingName Ltd.",
    "receiverId": "9925:be0123456789",
    "receiverName": "BuyerTradingName AS",
    "createdAt": "2025-09-12T17:18:04.000Z",
    "amount": "1656.25",
    "docId": "Snippet1"
  },
```

To fetch the XML of a specific one:
```sh
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ONE" $PROXY_HOST/v2/invoices/incoming/e37b5843-fc55-4b0b-8b8e-73435d9a0363
```
Note that this will only work for invoices whose platformId prefix matches the BACKEND env var, which by default is `peppyrus`.

## Deployment
### On the host system of your laptop
Ask @michielbdejong if you need to run this code in development, because the current instructions require Peppyrus API credentials.
You could also create your own API key [through Peppyrus directly](https://customer.peppyrus.be/) if you want to use this code in an instance independent from the one sponsored by Ponder Source.

Apart from a Peppyrus account you will need a postgres database somewhere (for instance through `docker compose up -d`) and that you have the [`json` CLI tool](https://github.com/trentm/json?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) installed.
Create a `proxy/.env` file that looks like this:
```sh
PORT=3000
ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY="some-other-secret"
PEPPYRUS_TOKEN_TEST="see https://customer.test.peppyrus.be/customer/organization/api to create"
DATABASE_URL="postgres://syncables:syncables@localhost:5432/syncables?sslmode=disable"
```

Then run:
```sh
cd proxy
# load the variables from your .env file:
export $(xargs < .env)
# run the proxy:
pnpm install
pnpm build
docker compose up -d # for postgresql
pnpm build
docker exec -it db psql postgresql://syncables:syncables@localhost:5432/syncables -c "create type direction as enum ('incoming', 'outgoing');"
docker exec -it db psql postgresql://syncables:syncables@localhost:5432/syncables -c "create type docType as enum ('invoice', 'credit-note');"
docker exec -it db psql postgresql://syncables:syncables@localhost:5432/syncables -c "create table FrontDocs (senderId text, senderName text, receiverId text, receiverName text, docType docType, direction direction, docId text, amount numeric, platformId text primary key, createdAt timestamp);"
pnpm start
export PROXY_HOST=http://localhost:3000
```
The db table will be filled up by the [syncables cron job](https://github.com/tubsproject/syncables/blob/main/src/cron.ts) which admittedly is not fully documented yet. Ask @michielbdejong for help.

### With Docker
The Docker image takes the same 'PORT', 'PEPPYRUS_TOKEN_TEST', 'ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY', and 'DATABASE_URL' environment variables, and optionally 'BACKEND'.
```sh
docker build -t proxy .
export ACUBE_TOKEN=`./auth.sh | json token`
docker run -d -e PEPPYRUS_TOKEN_TEST=$ACUBE_TOKEN -e BACKEND=peppyrus -e PORT=3000 -e ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY=something-secret -e DATABASE_URL="postgres://syncables:syncables@localhost:5432/syncables?sslmode=disable" -p 3000:3000 proxy
export PROXY_HOST=http://localhost:3000
```

### With Nix
A `devenv` environment is available in the `dev/proxy` directory to host the proxy locally and run a small test. Make sure you have [`devenv`](https://devenv.sh/getting-started/) installed, and optionally install [`direnv`](https://devenv.sh/automatic-shell-activation/) for automatic shell activation. If you don’t use `direnv`, you’ll need to run `devenv shell` manually in the `dev/proxy` directory. Next, create a `dev/.env` file with the following contents (without quotes):
```sh
PORT=3000
PEPPYRUS_TOKEN_TEST=see https://customer.test.peppyrus.be/customer/organization/api to create
ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY=some-other-secret
DATABASE_URL="postgres://syncables:syncables@localhost:5432/syncables?sslmode=disable"
BACKEND=peppyrus
```
Then run:
```sh
cd dev
# if the environment is blocked then run `direnv allow` to approve its content
# if you don't use direnv then run `devenv shell`
start-proxy
```

Open a new shell to test the proxy and run:
```sh
cd dev
test-proxy
```

### At a Platform-as-a-Service provider like Heroku
There is a Heroku instance running at api.letspeppol.org.
You can also deploy staging instances elsewhere.

If you host it on a platform other than Heroku you might need to add your own TLS-offloading proxy, and then the environment variables and `pnpm install; pnpm build; pnpm start` commands will be similar to how it works in development.

### Pushing changes to Heroku
* Select 'deploy using Heroku git' in the Heroku setting.
* Do the Heroku git checkout so that a 'letspeppol' folder is added next to the proxy folder in your checkout of this repo.
* In the `proxy` folder run `./deploy.sh` to push changes to Heroku
